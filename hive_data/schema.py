"""The columns these operations are written against, declared.

Two uses, and the second is why it is a declaration rather than a comment.

Every read names its columns from here instead of selecting everything. A
`SELECT *` on `core.sessions` hands back `carry_forward` and
`resend_content`, which are a composed prompt and a queued message - and the
listings that read sessions answer to the service token every surface bot in
the hive holds, so one careless read publishes a conversation's context to
every bot.

And the pool checks the applied database against this when it opens. A
column named here that the database does not have otherwise arrives as a
missing key in a dict, which the first consumer reads as a value:
`session.get("rotation_armed") or 0` is "nothing armed" on the one column
whose three states decide whether a permanent session row is kept or retired.
